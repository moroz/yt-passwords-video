## Introduction

In my previous video, I showed you how to connect to a Postgres database in Go using `sqlx` and `pq`.
We also created a database table to store user data.
Today, I would like to build on that foundation to implement password authentication using Argon2.
If you have watched my previous video, you can pick up where we left off, but if you haven't, it's also fine, there is to the Github repo in the description below and you can use it as a starting point.

## How password hashing works

First, we need to understand how password hashing algorithms work.
Meet Bob. Bob wants to create an account on our website. He inputs his email address and a password.
We need to transform his password in such a way that we can, at any time, check if the password is correct.
However, we also need to make sure that a malicious actor won't be able to easily guess what his password is, just by looking at the encrypted form.
This is why password hashing algorithms were invented.
A password hashing algorithm takes Bob's password, mixes it together with a random value called "salt," and applies some sort of very expensive computations, so we end up with a string that looks like this.
This string contains an identifier of the hashing algorithm, its parameters, the salting value, and the result of all those computations.
Whenever Bob wants to sign in, we take his password, add the salt and apply the same computations.
If we end up with the same value, it means that the password is correct and that we can let Bob into the system.

## Installing Argon2id library for Go

In this video, we're going to be using a password hashing function called "argon2id".
Let's start by installing this library called `argon2id`, if you have trouble finding it, there is a link in the description below.
Open a terminal and cd into the directory for the "goma" project that we started in the previous video.
On the website of the package, click on the clipboard icon to copy the import path to the system clipboard.
Then, in the terminal, type `go get `, then paste the import path and press Enter.

## Argon2id presentation and demonstration

Using `mkdir -p`, create a directory at `exp/argon`, and inside that directory, create a file named `main.go` and open it in a code editor.
The `exp` stands for "experimental", because we are going to write a smaller program before integrating the password hashing algorithm into the bigger system.
In this file, define `package main` and `func main()`.
Inside `main`,
